   Hello,  Greetings and Salutations.  Welcome to my site.<br>
    <br>
    I'm the oldest of 10 kids.  Dad was in the military, so we traveled some.<br>
    I enjoy hiking (Logan Canyon and the Uintas), Backpacking, mainly in the Uintas,<br>
    road trips, playing video games, reading, and learning new things.<br>
    Also,  I will be glad and sad when I'm done with school.
